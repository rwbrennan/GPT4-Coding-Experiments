# Read a Python Program and Descibe its Behaviour
The following experiments illustrate GPT-4’s ability to read and interpret code. For the coding examples, we use a Python implementation of a Sierpinski “diamond” written by the author: i.e., a Sierpinski triangle forms the top and an inverted version forms the bottom. All comments were removed from the code. As with the "create program" experiments, the OpenAI GPT-4 engine is used with T = 0, p = 0.7. 

## Prompt 1:
```
Can you tell me what the following Python program does?

import sys
import math

def print_row(row, height, level):
  spaces = height-1-row
  width = 2*height-1
  small_height = int(height/2)
  small_box = 0

  if(level == 1):
    for i in range(width):
      if(i < spaces or i >= width-spaces):
        print(" ", end="")
      else:
        print("*", end="")
  elif(level > 1):
    if(row < small_height):
      small_box = small_height
      for i in range(small_box):
        print(" ", end="")
      print_row(row,small_height,level-1)
      for i in range(small_box):
        print(" ", end="")
    else:
      print_row(row-small_height,small_height,level-1)
      print(" ", end="")
      print_row(row-small_height,small_height,level-1)

def print_row_inverted(row, height, level):
  spaces = row
  width = 2*height-1
  small_height = int(height/2)
  small_box = 0

  if(level == 1):
    for i in range(width):
      if(i >= spaces and i < width-spaces):
        print("*", end="")
      else:
        print(" ", end="")
  elif(level > 1):
    if(row < small_height):
      print_row_inverted(row,small_height,level-1)
      print(" ", end="")
      print_row_inverted(row,small_height,level-1)
    else:
      small_box = small_height
      for i in range(small_box):
        print(" ", end="")
      print_row_inverted(row-small_height,small_height,level-1)
      for i in range(small_box):
        print(" ", end="")

def main():
  if(len(sys.argv) < 3 or len(sys.argv) > 3):
    print("ERROR: Wrong number of arguments. Two required.")
    return 1

  h = int(sys.argv[1])
  l = int(sys.argv[2])
  hf = float(sys.argv[1])
  lf = float(sys.argv[2])

  if(h < 1 or h/2 == int(h-(h/2)) or h != hf):
    print("ERROR: Bad argument. h must be positive odd integer.")
    return 1

  if(l < 1 or l != lf):
    print("ERROR: Bad argument. l must be positive integer.")
    return 1

  tri_height = math.ceil(hf/2)
  print("height = {}, tri_height = {}".format(h,tri_height))

  for i in range(tri_height):
    print_row(i,tri_height,l)
    print()
  for i in range(1,tri_height):
    print_row_inverted(i,tri_height,l)
    print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```
## Response 1:
```
This Python program creates a fractal pattern using asterisks (*) based on the given height (h) and level (l) input as command line arguments.

The program has three main functions:

1. `print_row(row, height, level)`: This function prints the upper half of the fractal pattern.

2. `print_row_inverted(row, height, level)`: This function prints the lower half of the fractal pattern.

3. `main()`: This function handles the input validation and calls the other two functions to print the complete fractal pattern.

The program takes two command line arguments:

- h: The height of the fractal pattern. It must be a positive odd integer.
- l: The level of the fractal pattern. It must be a positive integer.

The program first validates the input arguments and then calculates the height of the triangle (tri_height) by dividing the height (h) by 2 and rounding it up. It then prints the upper half of the fractal pattern using the `print_row()` function and the lower half using the `print_row_inverted()` function.

Here's an example of the output for height (h) = 7 and level (l) = 2:

   *   
  * *  
 *   * 
* * * *
 *   * 
  * *  
   *   
```
## Program Output 1:
As a basis of comparison, the output from the author's program for h = 7 and l = 2 is:

![Sierpinski-rwb-read-7-2](https://github.com/rwbrennan/GPT4-Code/assets/19438964/486c3a46-afd0-41f5-ac1b-fe55e9f53c6b)

## Prompt 2:
```
What type of fractal pattern does this program produce?
```
## Response 2:
```
This program produces a Sierpinski triangle fractal pattern. The Sierpinski triangle is a self-similar pattern composed of smaller equilateral triangles arranged in a larger equilateral triangle. The pattern is created by recursively removing the middle triangle from the larger triangle at each level of the fractal.

In this program, the fractal pattern is created using asterisks (*) and spaces. The height (h) and level (l) of the fractal pattern are given as command line arguments. The program then prints the Sierpinski triangle pattern accordingly.
